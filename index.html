                <p>Yu Shiragami, known for being the lonely kid in the school, barely had conversations with other people except for the class monitor Lizhi, Xun, and the teacher, he is being isolated by other students because of the business his older brother is doing and his Bless and race. Yu is a mix of flame elves and humans, flame elves originated in Kerismara they can live longer than normal humans and they are born with better control abilities in Bless. Yu was worried about the consequences that his Bless would bring him. First, his Bless is so powerful that he can easily pass the “Bless fitness class” he knows and mastered the basic and advanced Bless control technique. In daily life, Yu always shows curiosity about new things. and visit Lizhi, his childhood friend. But everything will change someday.

                <p><strong>backstory</strong></p>
              <p>yuna was the second daughter of the 6th 3rd apostle because his father was the 3rd apostle., Yuna’s family lived happily behind the wall in The Candle City until Yuna’s father received the order from the king which is to shoot down a meteor in 2 years, her father had a contract with the king he had to enforce the order to shoot down the meteor, he spent almost all his time finding the meteor for the king, he knows what will happen if he fails, finally after 1 year and 9 months he shot down a meteor but the meteor did not fell down during the last 3 month he got executed, his power should be heritage to one of his daughter for the chance of his family to stay in the Kerismara. Young Yuna doesn’t understand why her father didn’t choose to fight against the king and why the king killed her father. Until the war between Kerismara and Valvia erupted there was no apostle of flame to repress other countries. This year Yuna was only 15 years old and she Volunteered to become the new 3rd apostle. When she became the 7th 3rd apostle she gained the memories of her father and his final word, she finally knew why her father followed the rule of the king and the reason why he gave up the chance to fight back, memories of how her father became the apostle and the new order from the CHH. After a few years of protecting the Kerismara, Yuna discovered the truth behind the king.(真相是
              王其实是 [篡位者] 的傀儡, 也就是第一使徒的混沌的化身, 凯瑟很早之前就是混沌的眼中钉, 把碍眼的东西除掉是将件无伤大雅的事.)</p>
